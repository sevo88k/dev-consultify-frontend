          the tooth becomes exposed, it can cause
          discomfort in response to cold, sweet, osmotic.

                      worn away due to erosion, exposing

                      Furthermore, the biting edges of the

                        1st line measures: gently brush the margin of where the tooth meets the gum, high fluoride tooth paste and/or application of fluoride from a dentist. Reduce acidic drinks/foods from diet. Consider seeing your GP to rule out intrinsic acid as a cause, such as acid reflux.

                        2nd line measures: If 1st line measures fail to resolve symptoms you may need to consider covering the exposed dentine with a white filling material known as composite.
