                                            Origin- Overtime bacteria that cause tooth decay work their way down the root canal of the tooth and then collect at the bottom of the root tip. Your body fights this bacterium using white blood cells. Pus is a combination of white blood cells, dead tissue, and bacteria. Pus can eventually work its way through the bone surrounding the root tip into the surrounding gum forming a swelling (abscess)

                                            <span>Periodontal abscess</span>-A collection of pus in the gum around a tooth.
                                             Origin- Gum disease overtime cause swollen gums which pull away from the tooth forming pockets of space for bacteria to enter around the tooth.  As these pockets deepen and bacteria work their way down, pus will collect in the gum around the tooth forming an abscess
