                    If the cavity becomes large and the decay extends into the inner surface of the tooth (the dentine) the tooth will need a filling. This is when the tooth decay is cleaned out by dentist and sealed from the oral environment with the use a filling material. It is important to still incorporate preventative measures so that caries doesnâ€™t return to treated teeth or develop in new teeth. 
                    </li>
                    <li>It is important to try treat a cavity early, before the nerve of the tooth becomes infected or tooth much tooth structure is lost as other more invasive treatment may be required. </li>                   
                    <li>
                    Note: if a cavity develops in the root of the tooth a dentist may be unable to restore it and save the tooth.
